 * Using the variables in the previous exercise, which of the following
 * assignments are legal? Explain why?
 * (a) i = ic;
 * (b) p1 = p3;
 * (c) p1 = &ic;
 * (d) p3 = &ic;
 * (e) p2 = p1;
 * (f) ic = *p3;
 * In the previous exercise, we would need ic, p3, and p1 would need to b
 * defined; however, this isn't the case so this question is not entirely
 * clear.
